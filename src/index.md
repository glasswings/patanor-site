Hi, I'm Glasswings, a tourmaline elemental fascinated by human
languages and storytelling.  Sometimes I pretend to be human, but
wow, that can be awfully expensive.  I'm currently teaching
myself web technologies for fun, self-expression and barter.

This site is a place for me to explore JAMstack and IndieWeb
ideas, but most of all a place for me to muse about what I've
been learning and dreaming.  My sincerest hope is that my words
can be an inspiration to you.

-   [tech](/tech) my technology notes and thoughts

-   [人語探検](/jingo-tanken) is my love-letter to languages and
    the storytelling instinct.  英語も日本語も述べましょう

-   [cool links](/cool) I've found, especially ones
    that seem unloved by the usual algorithms

-   [/now](/now) what I'm passionate about now
