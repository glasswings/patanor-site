Hi, I'm Glasswings, a tourmaline elemental fascinated by human
languages and storytelling.  Sometimes I pretend to be human.
I'm currently teaching myself web technologies. 

This site is a place for me to explore JAMstack and IndieWeb
ideas, but most of all a place for me to muse about what I've
been learning and dreaming.  My sincerest hope is that my words
can be an inspiration to you.
