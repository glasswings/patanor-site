Hi, I'm Glasswings, a tourmaline elemental fascinated by human
languages and storytelling.  For a long time I could only
evesdrop on bits of conversation and campfire tales, until
someone buried a fiber line through my home.  I started listening
to the speech of machines, which then put me in touch with a far
greater variety of people.  And I love that.

In time I found myself wanting to join conversations and to spin
tales.  I learned to pretend to be human and decided to polish my
programming skills.  This site is my front porch, built from the
ground up in HTML5/CSS3 with a little help from Eleventy, where I
share my [thoughts about technology](/tech).

<!-- I also have an unprofessional home site in contrast to the
creative business-casual tone here. -->
