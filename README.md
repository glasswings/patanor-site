Welcome to the source of Patanor
================================

This repository contains the source code for my personal website,
front-end, build scripts, and possibly backend if I decide to add
those components.  I'm publishing it because I
want you, the person reading this, to be allowed to explore it,
play with it, and maybe even re-host it or take parts for re-use.

Personal use is completely open.  I don't make any guarantees,
but otherwise you can look at anything and run it privately.  If
you host publicly, though, the licenses kick in and include
some responsibilities.

The site is divided into code and content.  My code is AGPL,
meaning that when you host it, you also have to host the source
code for the parts you're using.  My content is marked under
various Creative Commons licenses.  *Some content is
non-commercial,* which I would like to clarify as follows:

        Do not paywall non-commercial content.  Do not show ads
        immediately before, during, or after it.  Do not charge
        for media unless you're a bona-fide non-profit.  If you
        would like an exception to these terms, contact me for
        permission and profit sharing arrangements.

Generally, that restriction applies to longer-form content, but
follow the licensing and copyright marks on each file.
